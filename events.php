            /* Psuedocode:
            After printing out the sidebar, we need to print out all relevant information from the events table. 
                        
            Step 1: deal with the special case when id = default, which in this case means display all events.
                Thus, if ($id == "default"){
                $sql = "SELECT * FROM events"
                }
            
            Step 2: else (in other cases), $sql = "SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_id =".$id
            
            Step 3: $info = mysqli -> query($sql)
            
            Step 4: while ($detail = $info -> fetch_assoc())
                print out all information returned.
                
            Step 5: Present image slider when a single event has been chosen. $pictures = $mysqli -> query('SELECT * FROM photos INNER JOIN albums ON photos.album_id = albums.album_id WHERE albums.event_id = $id')
            
            Step 6: print out all file path in the format of <img class="picslides" src=file_path style="width:100%">
            
            Step 7: import the javascript 
            <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/imageslide.js"></script>

            Step 8: additional styling may be needed in case of weird size of pictures, but we'll leave it alone now.

            <p>Adopted from the Running Man variety show from Korea, we designed exciting missions and racing for a unique event.

At that time he was a sophomore, and he decided to work with his friends to start a small event on campus just for fun. However, everyone liked his idea and he had to recruit a larger team to accomplish a bigger event.</p>
